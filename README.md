 ### Download Game
 [Run Game v0.1.8-Beta](https://github.com/JayceLovell/Run-Game-Graphical-Update/releases/tag/v0.1.8-beta)
 ### Part 1: Game Base & Description
The objective is for the player to find his/her way out of a dark maze using a flashlight with a depleting battery life and enemies who attack or runaway if the light is placed on them, if the flashlight battery dies before the player escapes or the layer is killed by an enemy they lose. Around the map are moving collectable batteries to replenish the flashlight battery life.

 #### Integrated Shaders
 ##### Simple Specular

 ##### Normal Mapping

 For the normal map shader on the walls and platform ground is creates an illusion of surface details by altering the surface normal using a normal map texture. Which encodes the direction of the surface normal in rgb color values.

 ##### Toon Ramp

 We used toon ramp as an additional visual indicator that the enemy/spook is chasing the player
 
 ##### Color Grading

 The color grading shader was imlemented using the color grading scripts done in the lecture exercise where the script defines the amount of colors on the lookup table, gets the scene color, add precision to the sampling so it doesn't go beyond the LUT limits and calculates the offset to map the image to the LUT. Additionally, using the a c# script to copies source texture into destination render texture with a shader by using Graphics.Blit. </br>
 
 We used a black and white color grade effect as it best fits the theme of the game. 
 
### Part 2: Shadows
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221447139-74a78f80-ee1f-41b2-9da6-01975d35b4c9.png)</br>

The shader on the flashlight and spook models, is basically implemented where reflection on the material takes the lights color and direction on the object's albedo since specular itself doesn't have a color and produces somewhat of a shininess also producing a shadow based on the light direction which in our case was a spot light above the game object.

### Part 3: Visual Effect
#### Particle Effect - Battery Erosion
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221447954-21bfee06-2fde-4134-b130-a1d34518e2bd.mp4
</br>The particle effect implemented is an erosion type effect custom shader which is used in conjunction with the unity particle system. The effect plays after the player collects a battery.

#### Decal

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221448448-2749532d-8283-4863-8adc-870569b72b82.mp4
</br>We added a breadcrumb decal system in the gaame so the player knows where that have travelled before in the maze

#### Lens Flare
![lens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221448618-8ef2a7a2-ad45-4737-bb85-90bab54fcd1b.jpg)
</br>The code takes the lens flare component and calculates the brightness and falloff, applies it to the spotlight at the end of the game. Also allows the changing of the color of the spotlight

### Part 4: Postprocessing Effects
#### Rim Lighting
![Screenshot 2023-02-04 145409](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221448849-fd8752b4-e86b-420a-8d7e-d494ee265028.jpg)
</br>The rim lighting shader effect was added to the collectable battery object using the shader script done in the lecture with a few updates to take a texture. 

#### Bloom
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221449062-9a721bda-f358-4d89-92bc-e9d0a347556b.mp4
</br>When the player mouse hovers over the car it glows, achieved by using the bloom effect shader and the threshold is adjusted by the MouseOn method being called.


#### Vignette
 ![vin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35810049/221449114-e5512bc7-f8a7-4f01-9c3b-ba7d042c1cd2.jpg)
 </br>The shader finds the center of the screen and calculates how far each pixel is from the center. Each pixel becomes darker the urther it is away from the center giving the scene a more horror type feel
